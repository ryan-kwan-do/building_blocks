# building_blocks
the odin project, ruby building blocks

These are my ruby projects for the Odin Project, Ruby Building Blocks section. Thank you, Odin Project!

Ruby files are in the /lib directory, and the rspec tests are in /spec. Feel free to browse, but keep judgement to a minimum. Or maximum. If you judge, it must be to the max.
